## Github Organization
All members uploaded their respective files into separate folders at the beginning. The master_file folder includes final versions of our code and all the necessary csv files that had our data + the geojson file used to create the map. The geojson file is from [Mission Local](https://github.com/MissionLocal/interactives/blob/main/docs/redistricting-map-final/FinalDraftMap.geojson)'s github page. We edited the file to remove duplicate information to make mapping in R easier to graph.
